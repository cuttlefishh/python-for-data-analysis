## Course Philosophy

1. You learn Python by doing, just like anything else. With a few exceptions, you're not going to break your computer by trying new commands. So just try it and see what happens. Print output of commands. Print values of variables. Kick the thing until it works.
2. Resist the urge to get frustrated and blame the computer when your code doesn't run. Computers are deterministic machines; it's almost always your fault. But that's OK! Your computer will give you error messages that describe what went wrong. Read them and try to understand them.
3. When you don't know how to do something, google it. You'll be amazed by the solutions you'll find to do _thing x_ if you google "python thing x".
4. Learn keyboard shortcuts, as many as you can. Tab-complete in the shell and IPython/Jupyter!
5. Remember Zed's sage wisdom:
	* Practice every day.
	* Don't over-do it. Slow and steady wins the race.
	* It's alright to be totally lost at first.
	* When you get stuck, get more information.
	* Try to solve it yourself first.

## Assignments and Grading

### Weekly Assignments

Weekly take-home assignments will follow the course schedule, reinforcing skills with exercises to analyze and visualize scientific data. Assignments will given out on Wednesdays and will be due the following Wednesday, using TritonEd. Assignments are worth 8 points each and will be graded on effort, completeness, and accuracy.

### Final Project

You will choose a dataset of your own or provided in one of the texts and write a Python program (or set of Python programs or mixture of .ipynb and .py/.sh scripts) to carry out a revealing data analysis or create a software tool. Have a look at Shaw Ex43-52 and McKinney Ch10-12 for more ideas. The final project is worth 20 points and will be graded on effort, creativity, and fulfillment of the requirements below.

Requirements:

* Submit your project as either: a Jupyter notebook (or collection of notebooks), a Python script (or collection of scripts), or a combination of the two.
* Use `pandas` and one or more package from at least three (‚â•3) of the categories below:
	- Plotting: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
	- Interactive visualization: `bokeh`, `pygal`, `plotly`, `mpld3`, `nvd3`
	- Statistics and modeling: `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`
	- Bioinformatics: `scikit-bio`, `biopython`
	- Climate science: `cdms`, `iris`
	- Any other domain-specific library/package
* Use at least three (‚â•3) user-defined functions.
* Optional: Create user-defined modules and classes for use in your code.
* Optional: Share your code on GitHub.

### Grading

There are 100 points total possible for the course:

* Assignments: 72 points (9 assignments x 8 points each)
* Final project: 20 points
* Participation: 8 points

Participation is based on completing the pre-course survey, showing up to class (when you are able), and completing the course evaluation (this is on the honor system as I won't know who completes it). There are no midterm or final exams.

## Schedule Overview

The course consists of 20 lessons. As a class, it is taught as two lessons per week for 10 weeks, but the material can be covered at any pace.

Lessons 1-3 will be an introduction to the command line. By the end of this tutorial, everyone will be familiar with basic Unix commands.

Lessons 4-9 will be an introduction to programming using Python. The main text will be Shaw's _Learn Python 3 the Hard Way_. For those with experience in a programming language other than Python, Lutz's _Learning Python_ will provide a more thorough introduction to programming Python. We will learn to use IPython and IPython Notebooks (also called Jupyter Notebooks), a much richer Python experience than the Unix command line or Python interpreter.

Lessons 10-18 will focus on Python packages for data analysis. We will work through McKinney's _Python for Data Analysis_, which is all about analyzing data, doing statistics, and making pretty plots. You may find that Python can emulate or exceed much of the functionality of R and MATLAB.

Lessons 19-20 conclude the course with two skills useful in developing code: writing your own classes and modules, and sharing your code on GitHub.

Lessons are available as .md or .ipynb files by clicking on the lesson numbers below. Readings should be completed while typing out the code (this is integral to the Shaw readings) and doing any Study Drills (Shaw) and Chapter Quizzes (Lutz).
