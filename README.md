## Course Philosophy

1. Just like anything else, you learn Python by doing. With a few exceptions, you're not going to break your computer by trying new commands. So just try it and see what happens. Print output of commands. Print values of variables. Kick the thing until it works.
2. When you don't know how to do something, google it. You'll be amazed by the solutions you'll find to do _thing x_ if you google "python thing x".
3. Learn keyboard shortcuts, as many as you can. Tab-complete in the shell and IPython/Jupyter!
4. Remember Zed's sage wisdom:
	* Practice every day.
	* Don't over-do it. Slow and steady wins the race.
	* It's alright to be totally lost at first.
	* When you get stuck, get more information.
	* Try to solve it yourself first.

## Assignments

### Weekly assignments

Weekly take-home assignments will follow the course schedule, reinforcing skills with exercises to analyze and visualize scientific data. Assignments will given out on Thursdays and will be due the following Thursday, using TritonEd.

### Final Project

You will choose a data set of your own or provided in one of the texts and write a Python program (or set of Python programs or mixture of .ipynb and .py/.sh scripts) to carry out a revealing data analysis. Have a look at Shaw Ex43-52 and McKinney Ch10-12 for more ideas.

Requirements:

* Submit your project as either: a Jupyter notebook (or collection of notebooks), a Python script (or collection of scripts), or a combination of the two.
* Use `pandas` and at least three (3) additional libraries/packages, such as:
	- Plotting: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
	- Statistics and modeling: `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`
	- Bioinformatics: `scikit-bio`, `biopython`
	- Climate science: `cdms`, `iris`
	- Other domain-specific libraries/packages
* Use at least three (3) user-defined functions.
* Optional: Create user-defined modules and classes for use in your code.
* Optional: Share your code on GitHub.

Note: There are no midterm or final exams.

## Schedule Overview

_Schedule is subject to change._

The course consists of 20 lessons. It was originally taught as 2 lessons per week for 10 weeks, but the material can be covered at any pace.

Lessons 1-3 will be an introduction to the command line. By the end of this tutorial, everyone will be familiar with basic Unix commands.

Lessons 4-9 will be an introduction to programming using Python. The main text will be Shaw's _Learn Python 3 the Hard Way_. For those with experience in a programming language other than Python, Lutz's _Learning Python_ will provide a more thorough introduction to programming Python. We will learn to use IPython and IPython Notebooks (also called Jupyter), a much richer Python experience than the Unix command line or Python interpreter.

Lessons 10-18 will focus on Python packages for data analysis. We will work through McKinney's _Python for Data Analysis_, which is all about analyzing data, doing statistics, and making pretty plots. You may find that Python can emulate or exceed much of the functionality of R and MATLAB.

Lessons 19-20 conclude the course with two skills useful in developing code: writing your own classes and modules, and sharing your code on GitHub.

To Change For Next Year
-----

See ./TO_CHANGE.md for most up-to-date version.

Update these lessons:

* lesson9.ipynb - Include x.startswith(), x.endswith(), and similar for string regular expressions.
* lesson10.ipynb, lesson11.ipynb - Slicing with Pandas: emphasize that label-based slicing is inclusive but position-based slicing is not inclusive. Negation operator (~): explain along with .isna, .notna, .isnull, etc.
* lesson13.ipynb - Give examples of scatter plot and other common plots.
* lesson14.?.ipynb - Condense and add some personal touches.
* lesson15.ipynb - Pandas Time Series. Condense and remove repetitive sections. Remove most of the business use cases ('B', 'BM', etc.). Add more commentary. Focus more on data science applications, eg importing a dataset with dates/times and indexing/slicing. Teach Timestamp and Period in parallel rather than separately. Mention that we can parse dates directly when we read the csv file, either by passing `parse_dates=[COL1,COL2]` or `parse_dates=True` if the date is in the index.
* lesson16.ipynb - Restructure for more logical organization.
* lesson17.ipynb - Explain OTUs better -- we can just call them 'species' or 'taxa'.

Updates to assignments:

* assignment8.md - In Question 2 or 3, have them add in the columns for 'YEAR', 'MONTH', 'DAY', and 'DAY_OF_YEAR'. They will need these in Questions 3 and 4. 


Packages
-----

Data analysis

* NumPy -- the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

Application-specific

* Scikit-Bio -- underlying codebase for QIIME, replacement for PyCogent
* Biopython -- has some useful code, but the Knight Lab hates it
* QIIME -- microbiome and statistical analysis package
* Others: math, collections, operator, future, csv
* Sympy -- symbolic mathematics
* Statsmodels -- to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests
* Scikit-learn -- tools for data mining and data analysis (including machine learning)

* Spyder -- interactive development environment with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features


Glossary
-----

**object** -- Pretty much everything in Python is an object: numbers, strings, data structures, functions, classes, modules. Every object exists in its own "box" called a _Python object_.

**type** -- Each object has an associated type (e.g. string or function) and internal data. Entering `type(X)` will give the type of `X`.

**variable** -- Name for object within a particular namespace. The type information and internal data (value) of the object is stored in the object itself.

**attributes** -- Other Python objects stored inside an object. For example, if you have an object stored as variable `x`, then the anything after the dot in `x._____` is an attribute.

**methods** -- A common type of attribute, methods are functions attached to an object with access to the object's internal data. They always contain parentheses afterward, with or without arguments. For example, if you set `x = 'abc'` then `x.upper()` will return `'ABC'`.

**function** 

**module** -- A module is any Python file without the `.py` extension.

**class** -- A new type of Python object that you create.

**package** -- A package is a directory of modules including an additional `__init__.py` file ("library" is a generic term sometimes used interchangeably with "package").

**booleans** -- TRUE, FALSE

**control structures** -- if, then, else, while, with, break, pass, try

[Google's Python Exercises](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) - I would assign the exercises for lists and strings.  


Survey of Tools for Data Science and Visualization:

* [Apache Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/)
* [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org/)
* GraphViz / [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/) / [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)

* Python with libraries. (SciPy, NumPy, PANDAS, matplotlib, networkx)
* [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/)


Potential exercises:

* [Scraping Data] Have students download data from Twitter, Facebook, Yelp, Common Crawl (web), MovieLens, LastFM (music) or other social data.
* [Mahout] Collect some works from The Gutenberg Project.  Have students create term-vectors and run cosign similarity to see which works are more similar.
* [Pig] [Analyze a weblog](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290-abdt-s12/assignments/assignment-1/) - A very real-world example. 
* [GraphViz / Gephi] [Graph Visualization](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290-abdt-s12/files/2012/10/Assignment3.pdf)  - Make awesome graphs. 
* [NLTK] - Train an NLTK Name Extraction classifier on a new entity type and (for example, artist names from a music web site). Evaluate results in precision and recall.
