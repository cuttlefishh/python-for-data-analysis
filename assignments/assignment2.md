### Assignment 2 - Bash, Conda, IPython, and Jupyter

Work through these tasks. For section A, copy your history containing the commands you executed for this section. For sections B and C, you don't need to turn in any commands or code; just provide your answers to the questions. Turn in a single text file of your answers. Please name your file `2_first_last.txt` or `2_first_last.md` (substitute your first and last name).

Note: This assignment assumes you have already done Lesson 4, installing [Miniconda 3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (Miniconda for Python 3) and creating an environment called `python3`. If you installed Miniconda 2 (Miniconda for Python 2), you should probably delete it and install Miniconda 3. It will still let you create environments using Python 2 if you need to.

#### A. Working with Conda

1. Make a conda environment called `python2` that's identical to your `python3` environment but using Python 2.
2. Practice activating and deactivating conda environments.
3. Use `conda install` and `pip install` to install additional packages to your environment.
4. List your conda environments.
5. List the packages installed in one of your environments.
6. Optional: If you are familiar with R, create an environment and install the R kernel using the instructions [here](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r).
7. Optional: If you are familiar with QIIME, create an environment and install QIIME using the instructions [here](http://qiime.org/install/install.html).

#### B. Python and IPython command-line interpreter

1. Launch your `python3` conda environment and find out which version of Python you are using. Then try to run the commands `print 'Hello, world'` and`print('Hello, world')`. Do they both work?
2. Launch your `python2` conda environment and find out which version of Python you are using. Then try to run the commands `print 'Hello, world'` and`print('Hello, world')`. Do they both work?

#### C. Working with Jupyter notebooks and Python basics

1. Launch your `python3` conda environment and then launch the Jupyter notebook server. Which kinds of notebooks can you create? Open a Terminal within the notebook environment; what is your Python version?
2. Launch your `python2` conda environment and then launch the Jupyter notebook server. Which kinds of notebooks can you create? Open a Terminal within the notebook environment; what is your Python version?
