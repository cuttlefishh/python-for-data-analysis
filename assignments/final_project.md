### Final Project

Choose a data set of your own or provided in one of the texts and write a Python program (or set of Python programs or mixture of .ipynb and .py/.sh scripts) to carry out a revealing data analysis. Have a look at Shaw Ex43-52 and McKinney Ch10-12 for more ideas.

#### Requirements

* Submit your project as either: a Jupyter notebook (or collection of notebooks), a Python script (or collection of scripts), or a combination of the two.
* Use `pandas` and at least three (3) additional libraries/packages, such as:
	- Plotting: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
	- Statistics and modeling: `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`
	- Bioinformatics: `scikit-bio`, `biopython`
	- Climate science: `cdms`, `iris`
	- Other domain-specific libraries/packages
* Use at least three (3) user-defined functions.
* Optional: Create user-defined modules and classes for use in your code.

#### Submission

Most likely you will have multiple files to turn in (Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts, input data, output files, etc.). Please zip or tar/gzip your files and turn in a single file named `final_project_first_last.zip` or `final_project_first_last.tar.gz` (substitute your first and last name). If you are turning in a Jupyter notebook, please run Kernel > Restart & Run All on your notebook before turning in.
