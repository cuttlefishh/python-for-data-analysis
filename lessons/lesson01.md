## Lesson 1 - Overview

In the first lesson, we overview the [syllabus](https://github.com/cuttlefishh/python-for-data-analysis/blob/master/README.md) and [schedule](https://github.com/cuttlefishh/python-for-data-analysis/blob/master/schedule.tsv) for the course. 

There are no Unix or Python commands covered in Lesson 1.

To get a preview of data science using Python, check out the video [10-minute Tour of Pandas](https://vimeo.com/59324550) by Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas. If you have ever wondered how Python compares to R, its main alternative in data science, check out this infographic: [R vs. Python for Data Analysis](http://www.r-bloggers.com/choosing-r-or-python-for-data-analysis-an-infographic/).
