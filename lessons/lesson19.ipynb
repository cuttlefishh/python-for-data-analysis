Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or the Python Imaging Library from having to worry about each other's module names.\n",

Each class instance can have **attributes** attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have **methods** (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put in philosophical terms, *object class* is to *object instance* as *type* is to *token*. For example, many of you have a MacBook (a *class* or *type* of computer), but the physical object you possess is a unique computer (an *instance* or *token* of a MacBook).\n",

Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\"\n",

    "* Keep your functions small and simple.\n",

    "#### Classes\n",

    "* Be consistent in how you organize your function arguments. For example, if you have one function that takes `(dog, cat, user)`, don't have another that the other takes `(user, cat, dog)`.\n",
